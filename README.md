# A collection of C# solutions for Advent of Code.
**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
I challenge myself each year to do as many as I can before Christmas hits.


_Note:_ I prefer a more debuggable approach in my solutions. Even when it isn't (strictly) necessary, I try to store intermediate results between steps and solve the puzzles by aggregating over the results.
